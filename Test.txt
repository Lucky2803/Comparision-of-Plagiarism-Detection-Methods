Undergraduates are generally familiar with the term "engineering." The overwhelming majority of them think it provides them with a wealth of opportunities and financial benefits. While some of these claims are not false, the way they are presented is far from the truth.
Unsurprisingly, computer engineering is the most sought-after field among students, in part because Indian parents read newspaper headlines about jobs paying eight figures.
In order to improve their career prospects, the majority of students prioritise learning software engineering over mastering the technologies in their chosen engineering field.
Aiming for a financially secure future is not wrong, but the main issue brought on by this herd mentality is the suffocation of employability skills, which leads to a significant mismatch between the frameworks needed by the corporate world and those being taught to students.
In India, students are conditioned to follow a structure that serves their goals at the expense of essential skills like creativity and management, leadership, and management skills.
Communication is essential in every field. Professionals must expand their thinking to consider ideas and suggestions from their peers rather than operating like robots with little human interaction.
Any organisation needs effective managerial skills to expand and accomplish its goals, so hiring managers constantly look for them in candidates. One can become noticed and stand out from the crowd by consistently producing original content, creative solutions, and unconventional thinking. This will foster leadership qualities.
Only 7% of India's engineers, according to statistics, are employable, leaving 50% of engineers without jobs and the majority of engineers who do have jobs unhappy with their pay scale. Because of this, a lot of people quit their jobs in search of better opportunities, which they rarely find.
The future is expected to experience an even greater decline if the youth are not sufficiently educated and made aware of the myths surrounding engineering.
The urgent need of the hour is to decentralise the learning curve, foster core competencies and research opportunities in a variety of engineering disciplines, develop business manners to encourage entrepreneurship, and give co-curricular learning activities top priority.
