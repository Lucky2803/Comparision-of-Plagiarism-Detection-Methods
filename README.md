# Plagiarism-Detector-String-Matching-

The project presents a text similarity checker that checks for plagiarsim between two text documents (Source and Test) by using Rabin Karp String Matching Algorithm.
NLP has been used to clean (removing stopwords, punctuations, urls etc.), stem (Lancaster stemmer) and tokenize the text before the similarity detection process begins.
Rabin Karp Algortihm is the preferred choice for this project as it is based on hashing and the percentage of plagiarsm can be scaled accordingly.
In the future, it is planned to incorporate levenshtein distance in combination with Rabin Karp alogrithm to imporve the accuracy of the checker.
